# QubicShield — Concept & Vision

> **"Whoever acts legitimately pays nothing. Whoever attacks loses everything."**

**Status:** Proof of Concept  
**Stage:** Looking for community feedback, testnet collaboration, and Qubic Foundation grant

## The Problem

DDoS attacks are one of the oldest unsolved problems on the internet.

The current answer is **technical filtering** — companies like Cloudflare sit between attackers and servers, absorbing traffic and filtering out bad requests. It works, but it has a fundamental flaw:

- Expensive — monthly subscription regardless of whether you're being attacked
- Centralized — Cloudflare sees every request from every user
- Reactive — the attack happens first, then gets filtered
- Single point of failure — Cloudflare outages take down thousands of sites at once

**The root cause is never addressed:** attacking is cheap. An attacker with a botnet of 100,000 devices pays almost nothing to flood a server with millions of requests.

---

## The Insight

What if attacking became economically irrational?

Not more technology against attacks — but an economic incentive that makes attacks not worth doing in the first place.

> **Every request requires a small deposit. Legitimate users get it back instantly. Attackers lose it.**

This idea is related to Hashcash (Adam Back, 1997) and Lightning Network HTLCs — but has never been realized as a complete, working web product. Anywhere.

## Why Only Qubic Makes This Work

On Ethereum, every transaction costs gas fees. A deposit of $0.10 would cost more in fees to refund than the deposit itself — the model collapses economically.

**Qubic has zero transaction fees.**

That is the entire reason this is possible. A refund costs nothing. A 1 QU deposit costs nothing to return. The model works at any scale, including micropayments.

No other blockchain makes this economically viable.

## How It Works

```
User                    Qubic Smart Contract        Web Server
  |                            |                        |
  | (0. derive keys from seed — local, never sent to server)
  |-- pays deposit + publicKey →|                       |
  |                            |-- holds deposit         |
  |                            |-- stores publicKey      |
  |                            |-- issues access token   |
  |-- token + SchnorrQ signature ─────────────────────→ |
  |                                  verifies signature  |
  |                                  (publicKey from SC) |
  |←── Access granted ──────────────────────────────── |
  [... each request signed — stolen token is useless without private key ...]
  |-- clean exit ──────────────→|                       |
  |                            |-- refunds deposit       |
  |←── 10 QUBIC returned ──────|

On attack:
  Attacker: 1,000,000 requests → needs 1,000,000 × deposit upfront
  → attack detected + signatures verified → all deposits forfeited → attacker loses funds
```

The smart contract is the single source of truth. No server, no trust required.

### What Happens to Forfeited Deposits

```
50% → burned           (permanently removed from supply — deflationary)
50% → attacked operator (direct compensation for the damage)
 0% → platform          (no conflict of interest)
```

No platform share by design. The business model does not depend on attacks happening.

---

## The Vision: The End of DDoS

> **If QubicShield works, there will be almost no QU to burn.**

That sounds paradoxical — but it is the proof of success.

A rational attacker calculates:

```
Cost of attack   = deposit × number of requests
Benefit of attack = damage to the victim

Once cost > benefit → attack does not happen
```

The goal is not to filter attacks. The goal is that they never start.

```
Today:     internet traffic = legitimate traffic + attack traffic (noise)
Tomorrow:  internet traffic = almost entirely legitimate traffic

→ Servers need less capacity
→ Load times decrease
→ Hosting costs decrease
→ Energy wasted on useless attack packets disappears
```

## The Path to an Internet Standard

QubicShield is not just a product. The long-term goal is an open internet standard — like HTTPS, like Passkeys.

```
Today        Optional add-on for API providers and developers

Growth       Browser extension, SDKs, growing brand awareness
             Websites adopt it voluntarily

Standard     W3C / IETF: QubicShield as an open protocol
             Browsers integrate it natively

World standard  Every device carries a wallet — automatically
                DDoS attacks become economically irrational, everywhere
```

HTTPS was optional for years. Passkeys were natively integrated by Apple, Google, and Microsoft in 2022 — because they became an open standard. Same model, same path.

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Developer calling an API directly

```bash
# One-time setup
qubicshield deposit --service api.example.com --amount 1000

# Daily usage — token injected automatically
curl https://api.example.com/data \
  -H "X-QubicShield-Token: $(qubicshield token --service api.example.com)"
```

Like an API key — but it comes from a wallet and burns on misuse instead of just being revoked.

### 2. Server calling an external API

When Website A calls API B on every page load, a DDoS flood on A automatically triggers mass requests to B. B blocks A. Legitimate users get errors.

With QubicShield, Website A deposits with B's smart contract once. Both sides have skin in the game — both protect themselves.

### 3. End users in the browser

A browser extension holds a small QU wallet and handles everything automatically in the background. The user sees nothing except a shield icon in the toolbar.

Long term: native browser integration, like the password manager or the HTTPS lock.

## Research: Has This Been Done Before?

| Approach | Exists? |
|---|---|
| This concept as a finished product | **No — not found anywhere** |
| On Qubic | No |
| On Ethereum/EVM | No — gas fees make it uneconomical |
| Lightning Network | Similar mechanics (HTLCs), but no web proxy product |
| Cloudflare / Akamai | Technical filtering — no economic deposit model |
| Academic research | Discussed conceptually, never production-ready |

The idea connects to Hashcash (1997) and Lightning HTLCs — but the complete combination of refundable deposit + web access + DDoS protection + forfeit on detection has not been built as a product anywhere.

## QubicShield vs. Cloudflare

| | Cloudflare | QubicShield |
|---|---|---|
| Approach | Technology filters attacks | Economics prevents attacks |
| Architecture | Centralized | Decentralized |
| Traffic visibility | Cloudflare sees everything | No traffic routing needed |
| Single point of failure | Yes | No |
| Cost when no attack | Monthly subscription | Near zero |
| Privacy | Your traffic passes through their servers | GDPR-friendly by design |
| Long-term goal | Manage attacks | Make attacks irrational |

For organizations using Cloudflare primarily for rate limiting and API abuse protection: QubicShield is a compelling alternative — decentralized, cheaper, private. For volumetric network-layer DDoS mitigation, QubicShield is complementary rather than a replacement (see long-term vision for the shield-node network).

---

## Current Status

This is a working Proof of Concept:

- **Smart Contract** (`QubicShield.h`) — written in C++/QPI, ready for testnet deploy
- **Web Proxy** (`src/server.ts`) — Node.js/Express, mock and real SC mode
- **TypeScript SDK** (`src/scClient.ts`) — wraps `@qubic-lib/qubic-ts-library`
- **Frontend** — API Tester, automated simulation, live dashboard
- **Tests** — 56 tests, all passing
- **Documentation** — interactive bilingual guide (DE/EN) at `index.html`

What works in mock mode works. The next step is testnet deploy and end-to-end validation against a real smart contract.

### Known Limitations (honest disclosure)

- **Epoch change** — weekly network restart (~45 min outage) exceeds current retry window. The Qubic team is working on this.
- **On-chain forfeit** not yet called when attack detected — testnet blocker, must be implemented.
- **Empty ticks** — transactions may be silently dropped and need client-side retry.

Full list in [README.md — Known Technical Problems](README.md).
